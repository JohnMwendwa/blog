JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```

```css
.grid {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr));
  gap: 1.5rem;
  align-content: center;
}
```
